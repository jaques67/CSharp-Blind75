# Grind 75

[Grind 75][grind75] is a study plan for Blind 75 questions by the author of Blind 75.  

The [Grind 75][grind75] website provides the ability to create a customised study plan of your choice.  
The study plan of choice has been split into eight hours per week for a period of eight weeks.


I have selected the [NeetCode][neetcode] website to see answers/approaches that differ from mine and also to 
explain any algorithms when I am stuck as I find the explanations really clear and concise.
